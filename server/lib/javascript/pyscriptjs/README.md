# PyScript Demonstrator

A simple webapp to demonstrate the capabilities of PyScript.

## Getting started

1. If you don't already have Node.js, install it. The official installer for the
   LTS version of Node is available from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. If you don't already have Rollup, install it. Rollup can be installed as a
   global resource using:

       $ npm install --global rollup

3. Install the demo apps requirements:

       $ npm install

4. Start the server:

       $ npm run dev

   This will compile the resources for the app, and start the development server.

5. When the compilation completes, it will display something like:

         Your application is ready~! ðŸš€

         - Local:      http://localhost:8080
         - Network:    Add `--host` to expose

       â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ LOGS â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

   Once this is visible, open a browser at
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). This will provide a list of
   demos that you can run.
